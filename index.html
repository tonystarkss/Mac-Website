            <h2>Macadelic</h2>
            <p>After the release of Blue Slide Park and I Love Life, Thank You in 2011, Mac Miller began working on another project. According to Miller, he decided to "stop thinking about what kind of music [he] should make and just start saying what [he] wanted to say." On March 23, 2012 Mac Miller released Macadelic and had a release party at Shadow Lounge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[4] The music video for "Loud" was also released that day. </p>
